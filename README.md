Different essentials to teach Machine Learning to other groups.
This repository will be updated as different lessons are required.

**Levels.**

- `Basic` : The most basic lessons, starting from scratch and self-contained.
- `Intermediate` : More advanced lessons that assume basic libraries are already known and installed, but still self-contained in terms of what is taught.
- `Advanced` : Lessons that employ the standard library structure, featuring more complex code not that self-contained.

## Structure

The repository is structured into the following directories:

- `/data`: Data folder.
- `/notebook`: Notebooks folder, with self-contained lessons.
